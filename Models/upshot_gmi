## gmi Overview

Upshot gmi is a powerful metric that identifies high-performing wallets and provides insights into the metaverse's identity and reputation. 
It helps answer complex questions like "should we lend to this wallet?" or simple ones like "are they gonna make it?"

To mature the nascent space, we need accurate asset pricing and persistent reputation. These components contribute reciprocally to each other's accuracy. 
Producing accurate NFT pricing involves grading parties in transactions. Quantifying different wallets and their activity in the NFT space is a challenge, and 
gmi addresses this.

### How gmi is Calculated

gmi factors include:
- Realized/Unrealized gains
- Number of transactions
- Transaction volume
- Number of NFTs
- Number of Premium/Blue Chip NFTs
- Age of wallet
- Number of Collections

Currently, gmi focuses on Ethereum transactions. Categories such as 1/1s, editions, membership tokens, and virtual land are not included in the calculation.

### gmi Categories

| Name         | Score   | Description                            |
|--------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| based god    | > 975   | Legendary wallets, big collectors     |
| based        | 900-975 | Based                                  |
| full degen   | 700-900 | Full-time degeneracy                   |
| part degen   | 400-700 | Part-time degeneracy                   |
| tourist      | 100-400 | Browsing, mostly                       |
| ngmi         | < 100   | Sadly, ngmi                            |

### Checking a Wallet's gmi Score

### Additional gmi Considerations

Reputation and degeneracy vary in the space. The challenge of attributing gains to different wallets arises when NFT collectors hold NFTs across multiple 
wallets. For the current gmi version, the wallet that last purchased the NFT is attributed with the gain/loss upon sale, regardless of transfers between 
purchases and sales.

Subsequent gmi versions aim to solve these challenges and provide more accurate wallet assessment.
